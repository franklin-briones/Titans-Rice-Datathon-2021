We're making a healthcare data project that even the Teen Titans would guffaw at.

Telemedicine is on the rise... who's taking advantage and who's being left behind?

# Overview

Our project was inspired by the relationship between the COVID pandemic and the availability of and affinity toward telemedicine. We noticed that telemedicine literature has increased in quantity over the past decade or so, and looked at the recurring themes in those studies. Noting that different demographics had differing access to telemedicine, we included the extent to which each group scheduled a virtual appointment. We determined which age, race, gender, and education level groups were most likely to seek telemedical services if offered, and then analyzed the presence of those groups in the census tracts of Houston to determine how willing the general population of each tract was to seek them. Of additional interest was the layout of Houston hospitals in comparison to census tracts. We ultimately found an opportunity for identifying areas that could benefit from telemedicine, but are currently underserved.
